# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Discovers hidden patterns
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- Common algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through trial and error
- Agent interacts with environment
- Receives rewards or penalties
- Applications: Game AI, Robotics, Autonomous vehicles

## Key Concepts

1. **Features**: Input variables used for prediction
2. **Labels**: Output variables (in supervised learning)
3. **Training**: Process of teaching the model
4. **Validation**: Testing model on unseen data
5. **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns

## Popular ML Frameworks

- TensorFlow (Google)
- PyTorch (Meta)
- scikit-learn (Community)
- Keras (High-level API)

## Conclusion

Machine Learning is transforming industries from healthcare to finance. Understanding its fundamentals is essential for modern software development.
